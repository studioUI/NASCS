#NASCS:
My application to NAS Dubai, as a computer science leader.

Hi teachers, welcome to my repository! These pages are all coded using CSS and HTML (other than this README), with a bit of XML. I would like to apply for the role as a computer science leader. Please visit the sub-pages; more information of my programming and designing history is there! I hope to be working with you soon. Thanks!

Yik Ting Lam,
